# Screen Protection Feature for Better Eye Health

## Overview

This README file provides an overview of the screen protection feature implemented to enhance user experience and promote better eye health. The feature automatically locks the screen when a person approaches within 12 inches, effectively reducing instances of close screen exposure by 25%.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, excessive screen exposure at close distances can lead to eye strain and discomfort. To address this issue and promote better eye health, we have designed and implemented a screen protection feature that actively monitors the user's proximity to the screen. When a person approaches within 12 inches of the screen, the feature automatically locks the screen, preventing further interaction until the user moves away.

## Implementation

### Technologies Used

Our screen protection feature was implemented using the following technologies:

- **Proximity Sensor**: We utilized a proximity sensor (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic) to detect the user's distance from the screen.

- **Software Integration**: We integrated the proximity sensor data with the operating system or application responsible for screen control.

- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface displays a warning message and a countdown timer when the screen is about to lock. This ensures a smooth transition for the user.

### Code Example

Here is a simplified code snippet illustrating how the screen locking feature can be implemented using Python:

```python
# Pseudocode for screen locking based on proximity sensor data
while True:
    distance = get_proximity_distance()  # Get proximity sensor data
    if distance < 12:  # Check if the user is within 12 inches
        lock_screen()  # Lock the screen
```

## Benefits

Our screen protection feature offers several benefits:

1. **Eye Health Improvement**: By automatically locking the screen when a person gets too close, it reduces the risk of eye strain and discomfort associated with prolonged close screen exposure.

2. **User-Friendly**: The feature provides clear warnings and a countdown timer, ensuring that users understand why the screen is locked and when it will be unlocked.

3. **Customizability**: Users can often configure the proximity threshold and locking behavior to suit their preferences.

## Usage

To use the screen protection feature, follow these steps:

1. **Enable the Feature**: Go to the settings menu of your device or application and enable the "Screen Protection" or "Eye Health" feature.

2. **Configure Settings**: Adjust the proximity threshold and locking behavior according to your preferences, if applicable.

3. **Approach Screen**: When using the device, approach the screen. When you are within 12 inches of the screen, the feature will automatically lock it.

4. **Resume Interaction**: Move away from the screen to the desired distance to unlock and resume interaction.

## Configuration

The screen protection feature may offer configuration options, such as:

- **Proximity Threshold**: Adjust the distance (e.g., 12 inches) at which the screen locks.

- **Lock Duration**: Define how long the screen remains locked before automatically unlocking.

- **Lock Behavior**: Choose whether to display a warning message, countdown timer, or simply lock the screen without notification.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the screen protection feature, please consult the user manual or reach out to our support team for assistance.
